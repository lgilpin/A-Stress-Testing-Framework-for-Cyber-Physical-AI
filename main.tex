Artificially intelligent systems are prone to errors and failures.  The failure cases of GPT-3~\cite{marcus, marcus2020gpt} have been enumerated.  But in critical, cyber-physical systems, the failure tests cannot be easily shown.  In this paper, we highlight the need for cyber-physical AI stress testing.  We show revisit methods from security to create \emph{fault trees} to stress test AI in critical applications.  We discuss the utility of this function for aircrafts and self-driving cars.

\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item[{$\square$}] Some quick history  (greg)
\item[{$\square$}] Why it worked so well (greg)
\item[{$\boxminus$}] Why the technology landscape is changing (greg)
\begin{itemize}
\item[{$\square$}] The exception becomes the rule
\item[{$\boxtimes$}] We’re not in closed world simulations anymore.  Solution space
is not finite. [Leilani thesis re-quote]. (Leilani)
\end{itemize}
\item[{$\square$}] Why we need to evolve (Leilani)
\begin{itemize}
\item[{$\square$}] Application spaces of new autonomous systems
\begin{itemize}
\item[{$\square$}] Failures of these systems
\item[{$\square$}] Where formal methods didn’t quite work - again exception
becomes the rule (Avs and another example: space, IoT: CCTV)
\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_self-driving\_car\_fatalities}
\end{itemize}
\item[{$\square$}] Our proposal: Need to Stress Test
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
All error modes cannot be represented in test cases.  Testing and
proving properties can harden these systems, but they are
inadequate--it is impossible to "formally" test all failure modes.
Consider a human crossing the street.  It is considered "safe" if you
look both ways and do not detect an oncoming vehicle.  The majority of
the time, this ensures a safe, planned trajectory to continue across
the street.  But this protocol does not include the \(6.25 \times
10^{-7}\) chance of being struck by a local meteorite, asteroid, or
comet impact \footnote{In 2014, Professor Stephen A. Nelson calculated the lifetime
odds of dying from a local meteorite, asteroid, or comet impact as 1
in 1,600,000:
\url{http://www.tulane.edu/\~sanelson/Natural\_Disasters/impacts.htm}.} Instead of building provable test cases, our
research is a complementary approach: we propose work on \emph{AI stress
testing}.

Stress testing is crucial for autonomous cyber physical systems in
\emph{open environments}.  Image recognition systems have been shown to be
brittle and biased~\cite{fooled}, but this is deeply troubling in the
domain of self driving cars~\cite{physical-attacks}.  These mistakes and errors
need to become test cases, similar to the types of stress testing that
is done in consumer vehicles, aerospace systems, and commercial
aircrafts.  

We propose a stress testing threat model to build trust and security
in cyber physical systems.  We show a proof-of-concept. (More greg here)

\subsection{Other ideas}
\label{sec:org4ff9cc9}
These are not isolated issues.  These mistakes happen all the time
even in testing.

\section{The Preamble}

You will be assigned a submission number when you register the abstract 
of your paper on \textit{EasyChair}. Include this number in your 
document using the `\verb|\acmSubmissionID|' command.

Then use the familiar commands to specify the title and authors of your
paper in the preamble of the document. The title should be appropriately 
capitalised (meaning that every `important' word in the title should 
start with a capital letter). For the final version of your paper, make 
sure to specify the affiliation and email address of each author using 
the appropriate commands. Specify an affiliation and email address 
separately for each author, even if two authors share the same 
affiliation. You can specify more than one affiliation for an author by 
using a separate `\verb|\affiliation|' command for each affiliation.

Provide a short abstract using the `\texttt{abstract}' environment.
 
Finally, specify a small number of keywords characterising your work, 
using the `\verb|\keywords|' command. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{The Body of the Paper}

For help with typesetting the body of your paper in \LaTeX\@, please 
make use of the familiar resources~\cite{Lam94}. In this section we 
merely highlight a few specific features. 

\subsection{Mathematical Expressions}

You can typeset all sorts of in-line mathematical expressions 
with the usual \verb|$...$| construct, as in 
$\Diamond\Diamond\varphi \rightarrow \Diamond\varphi$ or 
$\boldsymbol{R} = (R_1,\ldots,R_n)$.
For more complex expressions, it may often be preferable to use one of
the various equation-type environments available in \LaTeX\@, as shown 
in the following example:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
Z_i & = & \frac{u_i(x_i) - u_i(x_{-i})}{u_i(x_i)}
\end{eqnarray}
%
Here is a second example for an equation: 
%
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:vcg}
p_i(\boldsymbol{\hat{v}}) & = &
\sum_{j \neq i} \hat{v}_j(f(\boldsymbol{\hat{v}}_{-i})) - 
\sum_{j \neq i} \hat{v}_j(f(\boldsymbol{\hat{v}})) 
\end{eqnarray}
%
Use the usual combination of `\verb|\label|' and `\verb|\ref|' to refer
to numbered equations, such as Equation~(\ref{eq:vcg}) above. Of course,
introducing numbers in the first place is only helpful if you in fact 
need to refer back to the equation in question elsewhere in the paper.


\subsection{Tables and Figures}

Use the `\texttt{table}' environment (or its variant `\texttt{table*}')
in combination with the `\texttt{tabular}' environment to typeset tables
as floating objects. The `\texttt{aamas}' document class includes the 
`\texttt{booktabs}' package for preparing high-quality tables. Tables 
are often placed at the top of a page near their initial cite, as done 
here for Table~\ref{tab:locations}.


\begin{table}[t]
  \caption{Locations of the first five editions of AAMAS}
  \label{tab:locations}
  \begin{tabular}{rll}\toprule
    \textit{Year} & \textit{City} & \textit{Country} \\ \midrule
    2002 & Bologna & Italy \\
    2003 & Melbourne & Australia \\
    2004 & New York City & USA \\
    2005 & Utrecht & The Netherlands \\
    2006 & Hakodate & Japan \\ \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The caption of a table should be placed \emph{above} the table. 
Always use the `\verb|\midrule|' command to separate header rows from 
data rows, and use it only for this purpose. This enables assistive 
technologies to recognise table headers and support their users in 
navigating tables more easily.

%%% The following command should be issued somewhere in the first column 
%%% of the final page of your paper.
\balance

Use the `\texttt{figure}' environment for figures. If your figure 
contains third-party material, make sure to clearly identify it as such.
Every figure should include a caption, and this caption should be placed 
\emph{below} the figure itself, as shown here for Figure~\ref{fig:logo}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{aamas21logo}
  \caption{The logo of AAMAS-2021}
  \label{fig:logo}
  \Description{Logo showing the words "AAMAS 2021, London, UK", 
  with the 0 resembling the London Eye and the 1 resembling Big Ben.}
\end{figure}

In addition, every figure should also have a figure description, unless
it is purely decorative. Use the `\verb|\Description|' command for this 
purpose. These descriptions will not be printed but can be used to 
convey what's in an image to someone who cannot see it. They are also 
used by search engine crawlers for indexing images, and when images 
cannot be loaded. A figure description must consist of unformatted plain 
text of up to 2000~characters. For example, the definition of 
Figure~\ref{fig:logo} in the source file of this document includes the 
following description: ``Logo showing the words `AAMAS 2021, London, 
UK', with the 0 resembling the London Eye and the 1 resembling Big 
Ben.'' For more information on how best to write figure descriptions 
and why doing so is important, consult the information available here:

\begin{center}
\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/describing-figures/}
\end{center}
%
The use of colour in figures and graphs is permitted, provided they 
remain readable when printed in greyscale and provided they are 
intelligible also for people with a colour vision deficiency.

\section{Citations and References}
  
The use of the \BibTeX\ to prepare your list of references is highly 
recommended. To include the references at the end of your document, put 
the following two commands just before the `\verb|\end{document}|' 
command in your source file:
%
\begin{verbatim}
   \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
   \bibliography{mybibfile}
\end{verbatim}
%
Here we assume that `\texttt{mybibfile.bib}' is the name of your 
\BibTeX\ file. Use the `\verb|\cite|' command to produce citations 
to your references. Here are a few examples for citations of journal 
articles~\cite{GrKr96,WoJe95}, books~\cite{Knu97}, articles in 
conference proceedings~\cite{Hag1993}, technical reports~\cite{Har78},
Master's and PhD theses~\cite{Ani03,Cla85}, online videos~\cite{Oba08}, 
datasets~\cite{AnMC13}, and patents~\cite{Sci09}. Both citations and 
references are numbered by default. 

Make sure you provide complete and correct bibliographic information 
for all your references, and list authors with their full names 
(``Donald E.\ Knuth'') rather than just initials (``D.\ E.\ Knuth''). 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%% The acknowledgments section is defined using the "acks" environment
%%% (rather than an unnumbered section). The use of this environment 
%%% ensures the proper identification of the section in the article 
%%% metadata as well as the consistent spelling of the heading.

\begin{acks}
If you wish to include any acknowledgments in your paper (e.g., to 
people or funding agencies), please do so using the `\texttt{acks}' 
environment. Note that the text of your acknowledgments will be omitted
if you compile your document with the `\texttt{anonymous}' option.
\end{acks}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%% The next two lines define, first, the bibliography style to be 
%%% applied, and, second, the bibliography file to be used.
